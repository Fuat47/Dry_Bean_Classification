# Dry Bean Classification Project

This project is created to evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms on the dry bean dataset. The project involves preprocessing the data, then building classification models using support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the properties of different types of dry beans. These properties include the dimensions, area, perimeter, and more of the beans. Additionally, each instance has a class label.

## Project Stages

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as z-score normalization and removing highly correlated features.
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM models are built using linear kernel.
3. Decision Trees: A decision tree classifier is built.
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN model is built for different k values and evaluated.
